                        <p>The National Institute for Leadership Advancement (NILA) is SHPE's premier leadership
                            training program, exclusively designed to provide newly-elected student and professional
                            chapter executive board members with the resources needed for successful leadership and
                            chapter development.  Since its inception in 1986, NILA has grown to become an event widely
                            anticipated by members and highly respected by corporate supporters. This year, NILA will be
                            held at Oklahoma City, OK and UT-SHPE's vice president will be attending.</p>

                        <p>The SHPE Officer Retreat provides the SHPE officer board the opportunity to enhance their
                            leadership and communication skills. The program includes workshops, interactive team
                            building activities, and lectures. The workshops revolve around teamwork, budgeting,
                            organization policy and procedures, leadership styles, and goal setting sessions where
                            individual officers can focus on what they seek to accomplish within their respective
                            programs. The Officer Retreat is the perfect opportunity for corporate representatives to
                            interact with organization leadership in a small informal environment.

                        <p>As the first event of the Manitos & Manitas program, the Kick-Off prepares mentors and
                            mentees for their roles. For the first part of the event, students are informed about the
                            structure of the program and how it will develop both the mentors and the mentees. Their
                            roles and responsibilities are explained, as well as the benefits of being part of the
                            program. Corporate supporters can offer their wisdom on mentorship. At the end of the event,
                            the students are told who their “Big” or their “Little” is and are able to get to know them
                            one-on-one. <br>(Previous attendance: 70)</p>

                        <p>The Student Leadership Retreat is meant to develop SHPE members’ leadership skills and
                            encourage them to pursue leadership roles within SHPE and the UT community. The Leadership
                            Retreat will include workshops, some lectures, and interactive team building activities.
                            Corporate representatives are welcome to present about how their company encourages

                        <p>The LeaderShape Institute is a nationally accredited leadership retreat geared to equip
                            undergraduate students with the skills to lead with integrity and develop a sense of
                            community awareness. SHPE would like to send at least ten students based on their past
                            involvement within the organization. Students who show potential in taking future leadership
                            positions in SHPE will be considered and molded into the next generation of officers for the
                            organization. <br>(Previous Attendance: 15)</p>

                        <p>The Regional Leadership Development Conference (RLDC) is held each spring and is a perfect
                            opportunity for future leaders. RLDC helps strengthen student and professional chapters by
                            providing them with the opportunity to improve their organizational, managerial, leadership,
                            professional, and technical skills through several workshops offered at the conference. In
                            this conference, SHPE members are able to interact with other members within the same region
                            to expand their network and possibly exchange ideas that have caused their chapters to
                            thrive in their universities. The conference date and location has not been finalized for
                            the region. <br>(Previous Attendance: 25)</p>
