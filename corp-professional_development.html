                        <p>The SHPE National Conference is the largest Hispanic technical conference in the nation. The
                            conference provides educational, technical, developmental, and networking opportunities for
                            students. The SHPE Conference attracts thousands of students, corporate representatives, and
                            community leaders. The agenda includes: technical and career workshops, a career fair, a
                            graduate institute, corporate tours, the National Academic Olympiad, technical paper
                            competitions, and the Extreme Engineering challenge. The SHPE Conference also offers a
                            Pre-College Symposia which encourages middle school and high school students to explore
                            career opportunities in the STEM fields. UT Austin has a track record of being well
                            represented at the SHPE National Conference. This year, the conference will take place in
                            Cleveland, OH. <br>(Previous Attendance: 20)</p>

                            a large room of people. Members will know how to properly approach professionals in a
                            comfortable environment with small snacks and drinks. Corporate supporters will be able to
                            share their knowledge and give examples of great networking skills that they use in their
                            company or everyday life. In the salary negotiations and offers workshop, with the help of
                            the Equal Opportunity in Engineering program, we will teach students how to properly
                            negotiate their salary or job offer. Through this workshop, we will allow students to
                            practice negotiating in a professional manner and help them evaluate why their skills are
                            worth negotiating for. <br>(Expected attendance: 30)</p>
