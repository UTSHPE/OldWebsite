                        <p>The general meetings are utilized as a way to inform members about important events and
                            opportunities. These bi-weekly meetings consist of guest speakers that are usually provided
                            by the corporate supporter for the meeting. Guest speakers present on topics such as:
                            interview skills, resume tips, effective study habits, business etiquette, leadership,
                            community outreach, and professional development. Companies are recognized for their
                            generosity and community involvement through advertisements before and during meetings. Food
                            and beverages are provided. <br>(Previous Attendance: 140 or more)</p>

                        <p>This Manitos/Manitas, or M&M, program provides underclassmen with a “Big Brother/Sister” to
                            mentor and assist them during their transition to UT. Upperclassmen will inform
                            underclassmen of all events and meetings held by SHPE to keep them involved in the
                            organization. They will also help underclassmen members succeed throughout their first or
                            second year at UT by providing both academic and career advice. In addition, this program
                            allows upperclassmen to build their leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills. The
                            Manitos/Manitas support network connects students with resources and creates lasting
                            friendships within the organization. This year we aim to have at least 50 pairs, 5 events
                            focused on the 5 pillars, and improve the structure of the program by adding more monthly
                            goals for pairs. Corporate representatives are encouraged to participate in the program by
                            hosting professional development events. <br>(Program Size: 100)</p>

                        <p>SHPE organizes intramural teams throughout the school year in order to promote a healthy
                            lifestyle and create a sense of camaraderie. SHPE members have participated in flag
                            football, volleyball (2 teams), basketball, outdoor soccer (2 teams), indoor soccer,
                            softball, and other sports. SHPE has been known to make the playoffs in numerous sports each
                            year. We also organize groups for running, weightlifting, and dancing so members can
                            participate in local competitions. Supporters of SHPE Athletics will have their company name
                            printed on team t-shirts. <br>(Program Size: 50)</p>

                        <p>SHPE Señoritas is a SHPE program that strives to unite Latinx female identifying engineers.
                            It was established in order to increase the number of females by providing a stronger
                            support system through community building, community service, and professional development
                            events. This year we aim to have 2 events with SHPE Austin Professional Chapter, providing a
                            great opportunity for corporate representatives to interact with our membership.

                        <p>The SHPE’s and Salsa Formal is one of UT-SHPE’s flagship events. SHPE chapters from all
                            across Texas, such as Texas A&M University, University of North Texas, the University of
                            Texas at San Antonio, the University of Houston, and Rice University are all invited to
                            attend the event in hopes of uniting the region and celebrating the conclusion of a
                            successful academic school year. The Austin SHPE Professional Chapter, as well as alumni,
                            and the UT student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers are also invited. This event
                            provides a great networking opportunity for our membership. This is a great opportunity for
                            corporate representatives to be recognized at end of the year banquet and celebrate
                            UT-SHPE’s accomplishments. <br>(Previous Attendance: 100)</p>

                        <p>Once a semester, SHPE hosts Lonestar Showdown, an athletic tournament between different SHPE
                            student chapters around Texas, including UTSA, Texas A&M, UH, and Rice University. This

                            enjoy a day of athletic competitions, and network with one another and industry
                            representatives. This is a great opportunity to interact with engineering students from
                            different schools at the same time. Supporters of the SHPE Lone Star Showdown will have
                            their company name printed on the t-shirts and trophy; they are also welcome to referee the
