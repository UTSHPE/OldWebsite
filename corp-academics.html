                        <p>SHPE will provide funding for members to take the Fundamentals Exam (FE) or Graduate Record
                            Exam (GRE) throughout the year. Many students wish to pursue a professional engineering
                            license, but in order to do so one must pass the Fundamentals (FE/FLS) Exam. To be eligible
                            for this funding, the student must actively participate in UT-SHPE events year round. This
                            is a great opportunity for corporate recognition.</p>

                        <p>This program is geared to encourage our members to pursue graduate education. Each semester
                            the graduate representatives from each organization plan graduate laboratory tours in
                            collaboration with many UT professors throughout the Cockrell School of Engineering. This
                            program also pairs undergraduate students interested in graduate school with current
                            graduate students. Events include numerous graduate school workshops, networking events, and
                            professional workshops. This is an incredible opportunity to companies to network with SHPE
                            graduate students and undergraduate students planning on attending graduate school. (Program

                        <p>Every Monday night SHPE partners with Pi Sigma Pi (PSP) and the National Society of Black
                            Engineers (NSBE) to promote a studious environment where members can grab a snack,
                            collaborate with their peers, and study. Study nights provide two separate rooms for
                            members, a quiet room and a collaborative room, as well as tutors for popular courses,
                            including chemistry, calculus, and physics.  Corporate sponsors are able to come and give a
                            quick 15 minute talk if available. (Previous Attendance: 45)</p>

                            examinations. SNaP Study Blocks are long, quiet study periods that provide members with many
                            snacks and coffee as well. Supporters will be recognized and promotional material will be
                            given to students and presented during the events. (Previous Attendance: 40)</p>

                        <p>UT SHPE will be holding a Scholarship Night with prize incentives to encourage members to
                            apply for SHPE Foundation scholarships as well as other scholarships. Members will be given
                            a gift card for every scholarship they complete at this workshop. They will be given a list
                            of scholarships including the SHPE Foundation scholarships which can support them through
                            their college career and improve their brand. SHPE officers will be available to help
                            members through the application process. This will be a great way to motivate members to
                            apply for scholarships by rewarding them on the spot, but it will require heavy funding from
                            corporate supporters. (Previous attendance: 30)</p>

                        <p>The Make-a-thon is a team competition designed to test the technical knowledge and problem
                            solving skills of SHPE's Hispanic Technical Talent. The Make-a-thon, consisting of an actual
                            design competition, is held at the SHPE National Conference. In order to prepare for this
                            competition, we will host a fun mock Make-a-thon contest where M&M pairs can compete against
                            each other to be the champion pair, in the Maker Space. This will be a great way to practice
                            skills, encourage bonding between mentors and mentees, and improve our chances of success at
                            National Conference. (Expected attendance: 30)</p>

                        <p>The Pillar of Excellence Scholarships will help promote academic excellence within the
                            chapter. These three scholarships will be given to the member with the highest annual gpa,
                            highest increase in gpa determined by percentage, and the member who manages to maintain an
                            already high cumulative gpa. The scholarships will not overlap, so three individuals will
                            receive one scholarship. The recipients will be active participants in UT-SHPE activities.
                            The scholarships will be presented at the SHPE’s and Salsa Formal at the end of the year.
                            This is a special opportunity for corporate representatives to be recognized during SHPE’s
                            and Salsa’s academic highlights.</p>
